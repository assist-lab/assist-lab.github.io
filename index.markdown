ASSIST (Assured Safety, Security and Intent with Systematic Tactics) Research Lab focuses on the design and development of assurance frameworks for mission-critical, safety-critical, and security-critical systems. The assurance frameworks designed integrate tools based on theories of computation, formal methods, model-based engineering, architecture analysis, and software/systems engineering principles. This results in performing a rigorous analysis of systems or system of systems to assure the correctness in the behavior of systems.

The ASSIST Research Lab was established in support of the Harris Institute of Assured Information to advance innovative research in developing assurance technologies. The ASSIST Research Lab is directed by Dr. Siddhartha Bhattacharyya. The research focuses on the application of theories to practice. As a result, the research involves collaborative efforts with industry, academic, and national lab partners. Some of the present projects are related to providing assurance for Autonomous Systems, Avionics, Internet of Things, Communication Systems, Cyber Security, and Systems Biology.
