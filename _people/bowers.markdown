#### Doctoral Candidate, Computer Science

Jacob Bowers is a doctoral student in Computer Science and researcher in the ASSIST laboratory at Florida Tech. He is the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Hybrid Systems for Systems Biology (HSSB) and Temporal Constraint Solver for Timed Automata (TSCTA) research efforts. His research focuses on developing new formalisms for applied modelling within the hybrid automata space and novel techniques for verifying automata. He is particularly interested in applying theoretical mathematics, such as abstract algebra and category theory, as a way of defining languages over hybrid automata to more concisely draw notions like bisimulation between them. He is also interested in using logical methods (such as the differential-dynamic logic as defined by A. Platzer) to deduce formal properties of hybrid automata, as well as temporal and modal logics in general. He was a summer bioinformatics researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as well as an R&D intern at Sandia National Laboratories and a cyber analytics intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. He currently lives in San Francisco, California.
