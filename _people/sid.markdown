#### Associate Professor,
#### Computer Engineering and Sciences,
#### L3Harris Institute of Assured Information
#### Director, ASSIST Research Lab

Siddhartha (Sid) Bhattacharyya’s primary area of research expertise/interest is in model based engineering/architectural analysis with formal methods for the design, verification and validation of intelligent autonomous systems, cyber security, explainable AI, smart power grid, systems biology and avionics. His research lab ASSIST (Assured Safety, Security and Intent with Sytematic Tactics) focuses on the design/development and application of innovative formal methods to assure the performance of intelligent systems, formally verify correctness or predict future behavior as it evolves.

Before joining Florida Institute of Technology, he had been a Sr. Research Engineer at Rockwell Collins’ Advanced Technology Center where he was as a Principle Investigator and researcher on research programs with National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and Office of Naval Research (ONR). He also worked in several collaborative efforts on model based engineering and analysis with Honeywell, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Melon University and MIT Lincoln Lab. Prior to that, he had been leading efforts in the area of Software Engineering/Formal Methods and developing new program as a tenured faculty and Interim Chair of the Division of Computer Science at Kentucky State University. He was a summer research fellow at Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University where he worked on the design, verification, simulation and synthesis of mission control for autonomous underwater vehicles. He also worked as summer faculty fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where he developed methods for design and analysis of the complex smart power grid.
